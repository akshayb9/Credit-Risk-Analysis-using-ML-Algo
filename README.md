Loan Default Prediction and investment strategies in online lending

P2P lending platforms - like Lending Club (LC), Prosper, Peerform, Upstart, etc - provide an online
environment for matching borrowers seeking loans and lenders looking to make an investment. With
lower operational costs than traditional lenders (banks), such online lending platforms leverage
technology, data and analytics to bring quicker and more convenient financing for individual and small
business borrowers from investors looking for attractive investment yields. With increasing volumes,
what started as peer-to-peer platforms for connecting individual borrowers and individual investors has
today evolved to include institutional investors, hedge funds, etc. Also called marketplace lending or
alternate lending, such fintech platforms have seen significant growth in recent years.

The main objective of this project is to predict whether to give loan to an applicant or not based on historical data by building certain ML models.

Understanding certain paramaetrs by considering the stakeholders and their roles, and what advantages Lending Club offers. What is the attraction for investors
Started exploring he data by taking a look at the data attributes and how to categorize these attributes, in broad
terms, considering what they pertain to?
What are attribute types - which are numeric, categorical, and date variables.
The important attributes to consider for the decision task.
Summarise the conclusions and main themes from the intital analysis
Started building the predictive models for loan status by building a decision tree as it is a classification problem.
Built another model using Random Forest to check for a better performance.
Analyzed the cost factor associated with each model and compared the performane of the model.
Prepared a final report based on the analysis and suggest the recommendation based on it to utilize the model for future use.
